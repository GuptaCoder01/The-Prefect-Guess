### A "guess project" in Prefect likely refers to a project aimed at predicting or guessing certain outcomes or results based on a given set of data. This could involve building a data pipeline that gathers, processes, and analyzes data to make predictions.

Here's a simple example project using Prefect that guesses or predicts a random number. The idea is to create a flow that:

>Generates a random number.
>
>Takes user input to guess the number.
>
>Checks if the guess is correct and provides feedback.
